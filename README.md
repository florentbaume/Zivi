# Zivi

This repo is a collection of the different scripts I developed during my Swiss Civil Service at the Bundesamt f√ºr Umwelt BAFU in Bern (August to October 2017). Their primary use was to help the permanent staff to manage the Federal hydrological database (available at hydrodaten.admin.ch), such as finding potential errors in historical data, and checks the correct availability of the data online.
